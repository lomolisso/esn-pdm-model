    "# ESN-PdM Framework ML models\n",
    "This notebook contains the implementation of the ESN-PdM framework's machine learning models. These models are developed using the `tensorflow` library and trained with a dataset specifically generated for this project. The data is located in the `dataset` folder of this repository and consists of several files, each corresponding to one of the four classes the models are trained to predict. The data was generated using a BMI270 IMU and an ESP32, hence the features include the raw accelerometer and gyroscope readings from the IMU."
